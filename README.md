Swinburne Data Structure and Pattern Unit Assignments, Practice Sets and Exams.

The solution files are completely my work and any plagiarism is on your own accord. 
None of the tutorials, practice sets and exams are owned by me and are strictly owned by Swinburne University of Technology. 

This repo is just a guide to students undertaking the unit since this unit is quite challenging to majority of students. 

NOTE: My solutions are not optimal, all my grades were above 80% mark, however, further optimisation of code is possible. I do not take responsibility if anyone is found to have plagiarised or if their mark is lower/different than mine.
